\title{Write a compensation matrix into a fcs file}
\usage{
compMat_to_fcs(
  fcs_file_path,
  compMat_file_path,
  max_match_dist = 1,
  skip_check = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fcs_file_path, }{character, file path to the fcs file}

\item{compMat_file_path}{character, file path to the csv file of the compensation matrix}

\item{max_match_dist}{numeric, maximum string distance for matching channel names}

\item{skip_check}{logical, whether to ask for confirmation by the user if channel names were matched correctly}
}
\value{
no return; instead the fcs file at fcs_file_path is overwritten with an updated version containing a new compensation matrix as SPILL keyword
}
\description{
When a compensation matrix is made in flowjo it only exists in the workspace, like a mask on the fcs file.
In case the workspace is lost or gets corrupted, the compensation matrix is lost. To avoid that one may want to hard-code into
the fcs-file. This function takes a csv file of a compensation matrix as exported from flowjo and writes it into the SPILL-keyword
of a fcs file. Moreover, a full compensation matrix is generated: You may have noticed that a compensation matrix purely generated
in flowjo is not complete - spillover into channels can only be assigned for existing compensation controls. This is different to
a matrix generated by BDs DIVA software where spillover into all channels can be assigned, no matter if for respective channel a
compensation control was recorded. E.g. for a live/dead-channel we are generally onlny interested in spillover into the channel, not
which spillover comes out of it, as dead cells are not of interest in most cases.
